# 🕷️ Web Scraping Practice with Scraping Training Site

This repository demonstrates practical web scraping techniques using Python, targeting the educational site “[Scraping Training Site (Beta)](https://scraping-training.vercel.app/)”.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Implement basic yet robust scraping using the **BeautifulSoup4** and **Requests** libraries
- Master handling pagination (retrieving data across multiple pages)
- Clean, format, and convert acquired data into **CSV files** or **JSON files**
- Understanding the workflow of real scraping projects (error handling, data management)

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Product Information Extraction**: Extract data such as product names, prices, stock status, and ratings from the practice site.
- **Automatic Page Navigation**: Handle navigation to subsequent pages to automatically collect all products on the site.
- **Data Export**: Organizes retrieved data and outputs it in an easily analyzable and storable format (CSV).
- **Ethical Considerations**: Respects the target site's `robots.txt` and terms of service, setting appropriate intervals to avoid overloading the server.
